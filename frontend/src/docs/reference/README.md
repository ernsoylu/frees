# frees Reference Documentation (`src/docs/reference/`)

MATLAB-style, per-symbol reference pages — one markdown file per built-in function,
procedure, block construct, or component. This directory is the source the Phase-1
pipeline compiles into the in-app Help → Reference section.

## Files

- `_TEMPLATE.md` — the page contract. Copy it to start a new page. Do **not** edit it as content (the leading `_` keeps it out of the manifest/compile).
- `function-manifest.json` — **generated**, do not hand-edit. The machine-readable inventory of the entire documentable surface across `functions`, `matrixFunctions`, `callProcedures`, `propertyFunctions`, `materials`, `components`, and `replCasOps` — each with a `documented` flag, reconciled against the backend by `frontend/scripts/build-doc-manifest.mjs`. The authoritative count is `coverage.documentableSurfaceTotal` (**475 unique symbols**, deduplicated across families); regenerate with `node scripts/build-doc-manifest.mjs`.
- `<category>/<name>.md` — authored reference pages, grouped by category folder (e.g. `heat-transfer/hx_effectiveness.md`).

## The contract (every page)

1. **YAML frontmatter** — `name`, `category`, `summary`, `related`, `examples` (ids in `examples.ts`), `tags`, `references`. Feeds search + the manifest coverage gate.
2. **Mathematical Formulation** — governing equations in KaTeX, every formula citation-keyed, plus the numerical method the backend actually uses. **Citations are grounded against the NotebookLM "Frees" notebook** (`350fef25-…`), never model memory.
3. **Examples** — bound to backend-verified entries in `examples.ts` via `[Run: id]`; progressive and multi-domain.
4. **Common Errors** — error-code table with a triggering snippet.
5. **References** — full citations (textbook/standard + equation/section), sourced from the notebook.

## Grounding a citation

```
notebooklm source list --notebook 350fef25                 # find the right textbook
notebooklm ask "<governing equation / method for X>" --notebook 350fef25
```
Copy the cited equation numbers (e.g. "Kays & London Eq. 2-13") into the page's
`references` frontmatter and the Mathematical Formulation section.

## Quality gates (CI, Phase 1+)

- Every registry function (`function-manifest.json → functions[]`) has a page (`documented: true`).
- No page names a symbol absent from the backend.
- Every `examples:` id resolves and solves clean against the backend.
- Every formula page has a Mathematical Formulation section and non-empty `references`.
