# Resistor

An Ohmic resistor, `V = R·I`.

## Domain

A reusable **acausal electrical-domain** component — its electrical ports carry potential `V` and current `I`; a node enforces equal `V` and `ΣI = 0` (Kirchhoff). Instantiate it and connect its ports; the constitutive equations below expand into the global scalar system.

## Ports

`a`, `b`

## Usage

```
Resistor inst(R)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| `R` | Number |

## Constitutive Equations

Instantiating the component expands these acausal equations (over its port members and parameters) into scalar equations solved by the standard Newton/Tarjan pipeline:

```
a.V - b.V = R * a.I
a.I + b.I = 0
```
