Guidelines and reference architecture for AI coding assistants and developers working on the `frees` repository.

## Repository Overview & Philosophy

`frees` is a high-performance, declarative physical systems modeling, equation solving, and simulation platform written in Rust and WebAssembly, paired with a modern React 19 / TypeScript frontend.

### Core Tenets

1. **Zero External Backend**: The entire computational engine compiles to WebAssembly (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`) and executes client-side inside Web Workers, complemented by a native desktop CLI (`frees-cli`). There are no `/api/` network round-trips.
2. **Root-Cause Engineering**: Fix defects at their origin rather than patching downstream callers. Avoid speculative scaffolding, unrequested abstractions, or temporary bypasses.
3. **Target-Agnostic Core**: `crates/frees-core` contains pure mathematics, algorithms, and models; it must remain completely decoupled from browser APIs and `wasm-bindgen`.
4. **Deterministic Reproducibility**: High-precision numerical calculations, exact symbolic derivatives, frozen regression goldens, and strict tolerance tracking.

## Current Status & Verification Metrics

- **Solvers**: Scaled Newton-Raphson, trust-region line search, Powell hybrid dogleg, rank-deficient merge recovery, polish pass, and reusable prepared solvers (`PreparedDocument`).
- **Dynamic Systems**: Adaptive Dormand-Prince Runge-Kutta (`ode45`), 5th-order Radau IIA (`radau5`/`radauiia`), and variable-coefficient DAE BDF/IDA with zero-crossing event root-finding.
- **Properties**: Pure-Rust CoolProp 8.0.0 implementation (`rustprop`) for high-accuracy Helmholtz equations of state, cubic EoS, incompressibles, and psychrometrics (`HAPropsSI`). 26 real fluids are linked and served on the diagram picker — every pure fluid the alias table names. The ten `.mix` refrigerant blends remain unbacked pending mixture routing upstream. **rustprop is the property backend on every target** (decision D12): the precomputed `(P,h)`/`FRAUX1` tables D1 and D7 introduced are gone, and `props/tables.rs` retains only the `install_from_bytes` runtime fetch seam. Do not reintroduce a linked table path.
- **Component Library**: 295+ standard acausal components spanning fluid networks, thermal systems, moist air HVAC, mechanics, and electrical circuits.
- **Experimental Data & Statistics** (`crates/frees-core/src/analysis/`): weighted/bounded/robust curve fitting and dynamic calibration with SVD parameter covariance; correlated and non-Gaussian input uncertainty declared in the document as `Correlation(A, B) = ρ` and `DistributionOf(X) = Uniform(…)`; truncated inverse-CDF sampling; seeded Latin-hypercube and scrambled Sobol designs; Sobol' and Morris global sensitivity. `signal.rs` carries an `O(n log n)` transform (radix-2 + Bluestein, any length) and the sensor kernels behind the `Detrend`, `Smooth`, `Window`, `Filter`, `FiltFilt`, `XCorr`, and `Welch` multi-output functions.
- **Worker Pool**: Up to 4 Web Workers executing independent parametric sweep chunks in parallel with weighted progress, preserving deterministic row ordering.
- **WASM Bundle Budget**: Strictly gated at $\le 5,120\text{ KiB}$ raw (measured 2026-09-12 after D12: 3,981.7 KiB raw / 1,791.0 KiB gzipped, 1,138.3 KiB headroom). Raised from 4,096 on 2026-09-10, owner-authorized, to link every fluid the alias table names; the `ci.yml` header carries the full ledger and records that the lazy-chunk pay-down is now overdue.
- **Test Suite Health**:
  - `cargo test --workspace -- --skip golden_corpus_parity`: 3,323 tests pass across all workspace crates.
  - `cargo test --release --test parity`: 1,308/1,308 golden fixtures passing.
  - `vitest run` (Node 22): 59 test files, 655 tests passing.
  - `cargo clippy`: 0 warnings with `-D warnings` on native and `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
  - `npm run lint`: 0 errors.
  - `npm run check-docs`: 723/723 documentable symbols have a reference page. Every family is reconciled against the Rust registries (`eval::INTRINSICS`, `procedures::EXPANDED_CALL_TARGETS`, `parser::expand::MATRIX_FUNCTIONS`, `props::propfun`, `props::solids`, `repl::CAS_NAMES`) and the builder **exits non-zero** rather than reporting coverage from a cached list. It no longer reads the Java reference repo at all; the 100% it used to print from that fallback was stale, not earned.

### Module Boundary Invariants

- **`crates/frees-core` must remain target-agnostic**: Never add `wasm-bindgen`, `js-sys`, `web-sys`, or browser-specific dependencies to `frees-core`.
- **`crates/frees` is the sole WASM bridge**: Metadata and non-bulk results use JSON strings. Browser solves and sweeps carry bulk numeric tables in JS-owned `Float64Array`s transferred from workers; native JSON exports remain available.
- **Worker pool isolation (`web/src/wasm/engineClient.ts`)**:
  - Lazily spawns Web Workers up to the configured limit (clamped between 1 and 4, automatically limited to 2 on devices with $\le 4\text{ GB}$ memory).
  - Correlates in-flight requests by monotonic request ID.
  - Rejects stranded requests with `'Operation stopped'` when extra workers are retired (`retireExtraWorkers`).
  - Guards message and error callbacks (`if (!pool.includes(w)) return`) against late events from retired or terminated workers.
  - On fatal WASM traps, terminates all active workers and respawns cleanly on subsequent requests.
- **Prepared Solver Reuse (`PreparedDocument`)**:
  - Structural compilation (AST parsing, component expansion, call flattening, block decomposition, analytic differentiation, variable specs, dense plans) is hoisted.
  - Numeric pin mutations update in-place without re-compilation.
  - Lowered pins (complex mode coordinates `_r`/`_i`, stepped integrals, linearizations, array indices `x[1]`, members `part.x`) automatically route through `with_source_pins` for sound AST expansion.
  - Preserves user-declared casing in `display_names`.
- **Model Revision Coordination (`ModelRevisionTracker`)**:
  - Any edit to document text, tables, sliders, or settings increments the monotonic revision counter.
  - Background solves, checks, and sweeps verify `isCurrent(revision)` before writing results to React state, eliminating race conditions and stale UI overwrites.

## Essential Development Commands

### 1. Rust Engine Development

```bash
# Check formatting and strict clippy across all targets
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo clippy --workspace --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Run core unit and integration tests (skipping lengthy unsharded golden replay)
cargo test --workspace -- --skip golden_corpus_parity

# Run specific integration test suites
cargo test -p frees-core --test prepared_solver
cargo test -p frees-core --test dae_sparse_direct
cargo test -p frees-core --test constrained_optimizer
cargo test -p frees --test overrides

# Replay full golden regression corpus (sharded or release)
cargo test --release --test parity

# Run CLI headlessly
cargo run -qp frees-cli -- solve path/to/model.frees
cargo run -qp frees-cli -- check path/to/model.frees
```

### 2. WebAssembly & Frontend Development

> **Node Version Requirement**: Node 22 is required (`web/.nvmrc`). Under Node 20, Vitest fails during DOM initialization due to a `jsdom` / `undici` uncloneable error.

```bash
# Build the WebAssembly engine package into web/src/wasm/pkg
wasm-pack build crates/frees --release --target web --out-dir ../../web/src/wasm/pkg

# Install dependencies and compile documentation
cd web
npm ci
npm run compile-docs

# Run frontend tests
npm test

# Run specific Vitest test file
npx vitest run src/wasm/engineClient.test.ts
npx vitest run src/analysisDialogs.test.tsx

# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Compile production bundle and generate PWA assets
npm run build
```

## Coding Rules & Implementation Discipline

1. **Root-Cause Resolution**: Fix the underlying condition where all execution flows converge, rather than placing guards in individual callers.
2. **Minimal Working Diffs**: Write the simplest code that completely solves the problem. Delete dead code and unneeded abstractions.
3. **Documentation Integrity**: Keep docstrings and architectural explanations current. Quote exact user source spans in diagnostic error messages.
4. **Symbol Case-Insensitivity**: Variable and function lookup in the solver is case-insensitive, but user-defined casing must be preserved in display maps.
5. **Frozen Fixtures**: Golden fixtures in `fixtures/corpus` and `fixtures/golden` represent verified reference behavior. Never alter golden outputs merely to accommodate a code change; investigate any discrepancy down to the numerical algorithm.
6. **Lazy UI Evaluation**: Do not evaluate expensive or validating operations (such as table DTO extraction `toFunctionTableDtos()`) during React rendering; defer evaluation to user action callbacks within structured error handlers.

## Documentation Ownership and Verification

Keep enduring engineering information in the three top-level documents linked
by `README.md`, not in separate report/decision folders:

- `ARCHITECTURE_AND_REQUIREMENTS.md`: architecture, language contract, compatibility constraints and the retained rationale of D1–D12.
- `CLAUDE.md`: development instructions, authoritative source locations and maintenance rules.
- `NEXT_STEPS.md`: signed milestones, unresolved findings and acceptance criteria. Label historical findings that have not been reverified; do not turn an old review into a claim that a bug remains open.

User guides and per-symbol reference pages live only in `web/src/docs/`.
Generated Help catalogs are build outputs, not independently authored sources.
Do not recreate a single-file reference or audit archive in the repository.
Keep essential findings here; Git history retains committed historical narratives.

### Callable sources of truth

| Family | Authoritative implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Scalar, lazy, statistics, special functions | `crates/frees-core/src/eval.rs` — `INTRINSICS` |
| Matrix expansion | `crates/frees-core/src/parser/expand.rs` — `MATRIX_FUNCTIONS` and shape handlers |
| Multi-output dispatch | `crates/frees-core/src/procedures.rs` — `EXPANDED_CALL_TARGETS`; expansion handlers in `parser/expand.rs` |
| Control systems | `crates/frees-core/src/control/flatten.rs` — `CALL_NAMES` |
| Properties and materials | `crates/frees-core/src/props/propfun.rs` and `props/solids.rs` |
| Analysis jobs | `crates/frees-core/src/analysis/` and `crates/frees/src/analysis.rs` |
| User declarations | `crates/frees-core/src/parser/defs.rs` — `Definitions`, with resolution and lowering in `parser/` |
| Components and ports | `crates/frees-core/src/components/def.rs` and `components/library-data/` |
| REPL/CAS | `crates/frees/src/repl.rs` — `CAS_NAMES` and context restrictions |

Names such as `callProcedures` and `EXPANDED_CALL_TARGETS` are internal compatibility
identifiers, not a public `CALL` syntax. Trace argument order, defaults, accepted
types, output shapes, units, evaluation context, determinism and work budgets to
these implementations. Do not invent missing signatures from a page's presence
in the manifest. REPL examples require a solved document first and must respect
the REPL's scalar/CAS restrictions.

### Reference-page gates

Every reference needs a realistic, complete example and verified expected output.
Use `{ CHECK variable expected tolerance }` comments in `frees` fences; supported
JSON requests cover table and analysis workflows and exact REPL results. A known
unsupported invocation needs an asserted diagnostic and a working alternative.
Gallery links supplement rather than replace the example. Mathematical
formulations use LaTeX; executable syntax and connection topology remain code.

```sh
cd web
nvm use                 # selects web/.nvmrc; verify the active shell, not only installation
npm run check-docs      # Rust registry coverage, references, and KaTeX display parsing
npm run check-examples  # runs examples through src/wasm/pkg, including page-level coverage
npm run compile-docs    # refreshes in-app Help
```

If engine code changes, rebuild the WASM module before treating the example
runner as evidence of that change. For new constitutive listings, run
`node web/scripts/format-doc-equations.mjs` from the root; it reuses the Rust
expression renderer. Keep `cargo test -p frees-core parser::latex --lib` green.
For documentation-only changes, distinguish the existing binary's numerical
verification from a fresh engine build.

Audit evidence belongs outside the repository when it is temporary. Do not claim
that deleted or untracked measurement harnesses are reproducible project tools.
Use the maintained commands above and record the tested revision and scope.
