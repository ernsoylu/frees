# compressibilityfactor

Compressibility factor Z = P/(ρRT) [–] of a fluid at a state fixed by named inputs.

## Syntax

```
Z = CompressibilityFactor(Fluid, X1=…, X2=…)
```

## Description

`CompressibilityFactor(Fluid, X1=…, X2=…)` returns the compressibility factor Z = P/(ρRT) [–] of `Fluid` at the state fixed by two named inputs (see *Valid input pairs*). `Fluid` is a fluid name or alias, bare (`Water`) or as a string variable (`fluid$`); names and indicators are case-insensitive. Results are in SI base units.

Same quantity as `Compressibility`; 1 for an ideal gas.

## Valid input pairs

A real-fluid state is fixed by **two** named inputs, in any order and any case. Indicators: `T` [K], `P` [Pa], `h` [J/kg], `s` [J/kg-K], `u` [J/kg], `v` [m^3/kg] (or `d`/`rho` [kg/m^3]), `x` (or `q`) [–]. Pairs verified through the engine for real fluids:

| Pair | Single phase |
| --- | --- |
| `T`, `P` | ✓ |
| `T`, `h` | ✓ |
| `T`, `s` | ✓ |
| `T`, `u` | ✓ |
| `T`, `v` | ✓ |
| `P`, `h` | ✓ |
| `P`, `s` | ✓ |
| `P`, `u` | ✓ |
| `P`, `v` | ✓ |
| `h`, `s` | ✓ |
| `h`, `v` | ✓ |
| `s`, `v` | ✓ |
| `u`, `v` | ✓ |

Inside the two-phase dome use quality with `T`, `P` or `v`: `(T, x)`, `(P, x)`, `(v, x)`. **Not supported:** `(h, u)`, `(s, u)`, and quality with `h`, `s` or `u` — the engine reports *Input pair variable is invalid*.

## Fluid support

| Fluid class | Supported | Inputs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real fluids (`Water`, `R134a`, `CarbonDioxide`, …) | ✓ | Every pair in the table above |
| Pseudo-pure mixtures (`Air`) | ✓ | Pairs containing `T` or `P`; `x` only 0 or 1 |
| Ideal gases (spelled formulas: `N2`, `CO2`, `CH4`, …) | ✓ | `T` only |
| Incompressibles and glycols (`EG50`, …) | — | — |
| Humid air (`AirH2O`) | — | Not a humid-air output |

{ Verification problems from a standard thermodynamics textbook.
  This example demonstrates the compressibility factor (Z) of real fluids
  and stagnation properties for compressible flow. }

{ --- Part 1: Nelson-Obert Compressibility (Example 3-12 / 3-13) --- }
{ Determine the compressibility factor Z and specific volume v of R-134a
  at T = 50 C and P = 1 MPa. Compare to ideal gas. }
T_r134a = 50 [C]
P_r134a = 1 [MPa]

Z_real = CompressibilityFactor(R134a, T=T_r134a, P=P_r134a)
v_real = Volume(R134a, T=T_r134a, P=P_r134a)

{ We can also check critical properties of R134a: }
T_crit_r134a = T_crit(R134a)
P_crit_r134a = P_crit(R134a)

{ --- Part 2: Diffuser Stagnation Properties (Example 17-1) --- }
{ Air enters a diffuser at static temperature T = 300 K, static pressure
  P = 100 kPa with a velocity V = 200 m/s. k = 1.4, cp = 1005 J/kg-K. }
T_air = 300 [K]
P_air = 100 [kPa]
V_air = 200 [m/s]
cp_air = 1005 [J/kg-K]
k_air = 1.4

T0_air = StagnationTemp(T_air, V_air, cp_air)
P0_air = StagnationPres(P_air, T_air, T0_air, k_air)

{ CHECK P0_air 125206.7702 0.12520677019884116 }
{ CHECK P_crit_r134a 4059276.374 4.059276373791066 }
{ CHECK T0_air 319.9004975 0.0003199004975124378 }
```

Expected output (selected solution values; numerical rounding may vary):

```text
P0_air = 125206.7702 [Pa]
P_crit_r134a = 4059276.374 [Pa]
T0_air = 319.9004975 [K]

## Input Arguments

| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Fluid` | Name or string | Yes | Fluid name or alias (`Water`, `R134a`, `r744`, …) or a string variable such as `fluid$`. See *Supported Fluids*. |
| `X1=…, X2=…` | Number | Yes | Two named state inputs from *Valid input pairs*, in SI units. |

## Output Arguments

| Argument | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Z` | Number | Compressibility factor Z = P/(ρRT) [–]. |

## Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CompressibilityFactor requires a fluid and exactly two property indicators, e.g. …` | One indicator (or three) was given | Pass exactly two, e.g. `T=…, P=…`. |
| `Unknown property indicator 'z' in CompressibilityFactor(...). Supported: d, h, p, q, rho, s, t, u, v, x` | Misspelled indicator | Use one of the listed indicators. |
| `Input pair variable is invalid and output(s) are non-trivial; cannot do state update` | Unsupported pair, e.g. `(h, u)`, or the same indicator twice | Use a pair from *Valid input pairs*. The message appears inside “Newton iteration stalled after 0 iteration(s)”. |
| `Unknown fluid 'name' in …. Check the spelling against Help → Supported Fluids.` | The fluid name is not one frees or CoolProp knows | Check the spelling against *Supported Fluids*. |
| `For now, we don't support T [200 K] below Tmelt(p) [273.15… K]` | State below the melting line | Raise `T`, or check the unit annotation (`[C]` vs K). |
| `For pseudo-pure fluid, quality must be equal to 0 or 1.` | Two-phase quality on a pseudo-pure mixture such as `Air` | Use `x=0` or `x=1`, or a single-phase pair. |
| `Unknown humid-air function: …. Supported: cp, dewpoint, enthalpy, entropy, gibbs, humrat, relhum, specheat, temperature, volume, wetbulb` | `CompressibilityFactor` called with `AirH2O` | Use one of the humid-air functions listed. |
